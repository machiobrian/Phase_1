create a positive and negative image directory
have your positive image(s)
have your negative imagesssssss

generate a negative.txt, a background, from the negative images: 
find ./negative_images -iname "*.jpg" > negative.txt

#create some positive samples based on the positive image

opencv_createsamples -img pos_right.jpg -bg negative.txt -info positive_images/positive.lst -pngoutput positive_images -maxxangle 1.0 -maxyangle 1.0 -maxzangle 1.0 -num 250

#create the vector file, where we stitch all of our positive images

opencv_createsamples -info positive_images/positive.lst -num 250 -w 20 -h 20 -vec positives.vec

create a data directory -> output for our images
mkdir data_output

#run the train command

opencv_traincascade -data data_output -vec positives.vec -bg negative.txt -numPos 125 -numNeg 120 -numStages 25 -w 20 -h 20 &

#we shall alter the number of stages based on accuracy...it takes forever to train on 30
